INTRODUCTION  TO GIT;

  GIT IS A VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM (VCS)

WITHOUT VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM : MANAGING WORKING FILES WILL BE VERY CONFUSING
AND DIFFICULT TO HANDLE,MAKING IT MANUALLY REPEATITIVE AND SLOW





VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM IS CATEGORIZE IN TWO(2):

1. CENTRALIZED: WHERE EVERY DEVELOPER JOINED IN ONE SERVER TO GET THE COPY OF
 THE CODE/PROJECT ,SHARE OR CHANGING WITH OTHERS. e.g Subversion,Team Foundation 
Server 
Limitation: Server Failure

2. DISTRIBUTE:EVERY TEAM HAS THE COPY OF THE CODE/PROJECT AND WITH HISTORY ON
HIS LOCAL MACHINE/SYSTEM ,SO WE CAN BE ABLE TO SAVE SNAPSHOTS ON OUR LOCAL 
MACHINE , IF ONE SYSTEM CENTRAL SERVER IS OFFLINE WE CAN STILL SYNC WITH 
OTHERS. e.g Git(Most Popular VCS), Mercurial 

Git is Free, Super Fast, Open-Source and Scalable,Cheap Branching/ Merging 


BRANCHING & MERGING ARE SLOWER ON CENTRALIZED VCS
